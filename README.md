Arcus-Energy-Monitor
====================

The Arcus energy monitoring tool is a tool to understand how energy is consumed in an Openstack
cluster. At present, it simply extracts information from Ceilometer (put there via kwapi) and 
displays it on a reasonably straightforward quite interactive JS based frontend.

We are of course working to make it more feature rich.
